We are a family experimental physicists â€” a hybrid of optical engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, architects, electricians, repair technicians, etc.

we're always looking for passionate and motivated undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs to be part of the adventure.
Join us on our journey into the world of quantum optics!


Contact Prof. Haocun Yu: haocunyu@mit.edu

# PhD and Postdocs
We value enthusiasm, creativity, open-minded and collaborative teamwork, and above all, kindness and integrity. Applicants from all relevant fields are welcome, but expertise in the following areas would be considered a bonus:

* Quantum optics and quantum information
* Hands-on experience in infrared and visible optics
* Data analysis and experimental control tools: Python, MATLAB, FPGA programming, etc.
* System control techniques and electronics
* Vacuum system operation and cryogenics 

Please email [Haocun](mailto:haocunyu@mit.edu) with your CV, contact information of at least 2 references, and a brief statement on your past experiences and why you'd like to work with us. It would be helpful if your advisor could also reach out.
