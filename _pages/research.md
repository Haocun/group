      <h2 style="font-size:2.0rem;">Overview</h2>
      <p style="font-size:1.0rem;">
      Our research focuses on advancing quantum technologies that go beyond classical limits, spanning from fundamental principles to practical applications:<br>
      (i) We develop and investigate novel quantum states with diverse properties.<br>
      (ii) We explore their applications in quantum sensing, quantum information, and quantum metrology.

    excerpt: 'We develop future quantum technologies based on the quantum states of light. Our work focuses on generating squeezed states, entangled photons, and non-Gaussian states for near-term applications in quantum information processing and learning, with the aim of breaking established limits and demonstrating quantum advantages in the communication and sensing of fields and forces.'

    excerpt: 'From enhancing the sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors to probing the interface between quantum mechanics and gravity, and extending to the search for dark matter, quantum sensing plays a crucial role in unlocking new frontiers in fundamental physics. These approaches employ unique quantum tools — including squeezing, entanglement, and photon counting — to achieve unprecedented instrumental sensitivity, paving the way toward addressing fundamental challenges, such as reconciling quantum mechanics with general relativity.'
#   measurements of fields and forces beyond the limit set by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle are among the experiments we perform.
